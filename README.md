# 📘 TryHackMe Walkthroughs

This repository contains detailed walkthroughs of various TryHackMe rooms that I’ve completed as part of my journey to improve and sharpen my cybersecurity skills.

Each walkthrough provides a step-by-step breakdown of the enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and flag capture processes. I’ve included notes, commands, scripts, and tools used throughout each challenge — with explanations wherever necessary — to reinforce both learning and understanding.

Whether you’re a beginner starting out in cybersecurity or a seasoned hacker reviewing techniques, these notes are intended to be **educational**, **replicable**, and **ethical**.
